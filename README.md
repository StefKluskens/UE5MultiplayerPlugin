# UE5 Multiplayer Plugin
A basic plugin that I made in Unreal Engine 5.2. This plugin allows for easy multiplayer setup with Steam. It uses the develpment Steam code 480 to test.

The plugin includes a basic menu with a host, join and quit button. These buttons are linked to the internal code of the plugin, but the style can be changed.
[The project] can also be found on my portfolio.
